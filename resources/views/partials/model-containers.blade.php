                    <p>In order to verify your identity, we'll need to process your passport or ID card photo, together with a video of your face. This verification happens automatically and only takes 1-3 minutes. Once the verification has been successfully completed, you'll be given the "Verified Person" status, which will help your customers trust you more and boost your sales compared to unverified sellers. You will receive +1000 to the rating or + 2000 / + 4000, if you have a pro / vip account. We'll place a badge on both your profile and your listings that confirms that you’re a verified person. When you purchase VIP status, in addition to the benefits listed above, you will also receive a discounted commission fee of 6% instead of 7%, and we’ll place a special status on both your profile and your listings that notes “Deals with this user are for a 6% fee”.</p>
                    <p>The verification and storage of your data is handled by a third party service called Sum&Substance, which is the official registered agent for the processing of personal data. All data we collect for processing is transferred using TLS 1.2 encryption and subsequently stored in an encrypted format in a secure data center, which conforms to the Tier III standard for reliability and denial of service resistance as codified by the Uptime Institute. It also conforms to the TIA-942 standard and has a PCI DSS certificate. Your data will be safe, and will only be released if there is a request from law enforcement if you have engaged in fraudulent behavior.</p>

                            We provide maximum security, which can be provided by an escrow service, but we can't guarantee 100% that the digital asset will be safe after the end of the transaction.
                            Rarely, there are situations, when digital assets being recovered through technical support or digital assets were boosted with fake subscribers.
                            We are not a store and do not check every listing on the site, so we recommend that you trade with verified sellers with ratings and reviews.
